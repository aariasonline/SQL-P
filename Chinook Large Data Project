This is a large SQL project using the Chinook database, here I created questions one might potentially ask.

1.-- Here I selected two tables ( customers and Invoices ) and joined them, afterwards I filtered specific columns desired and figured 
out the total SUM each customer purchased ordered by customerID--

SELECT CustomerID,
 Firstname, Lastname,
   address, 
   city,
    state, 
    country,
     postalcode,
      phone,
       email,
        SUM(total) AS total
 FROM customers
JOIN invoices
ON customers.customerid = invoices.customerid
GROUP BY Customers.customerid
ORDER BY customers.customerid

2.--Here are the Top 20 countries ordered by revenue spent--

SELECT BillingCountry, ROUND(SUM(Total), 3) AS "SUM of Total Per Country"
FROM invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry
ORDER BY "Sum of Total Per Country" DESC 
LIMIT 20

3.-- Organizing data by joining 4 tables together and renaming columns for legibility--
SELECT title, trackID, name AS "Song Name", albumID, artists.name AS "Artist", genres.name AS "Genre"
 FROM albums
 JOIN tracks 
 ON albums.AlbumID = tracks.AlbumId
 JOIN artists
 ON artists.artistID = albums.artistID
 JOIN genres ON genres.genreid = tracks.genreid
 ORDER BY title
 
4. -- Selecting only the customers from Brazil--
SELECT CustomerID, Firstname, Lastname,Address, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil"

5. --Selecting the Invoices for the customers from Brazil by Joining tables--

SELECT CustomerId, InvoiceID, Firstname, Lastname, InvoiceDate,Address, BillingCountry, Total
FROM customers
JOIN invoices
ON invoices.customerID = customers.CustomerId
WHERE Country = "Brazil"

6.--Selecting employees who are sales agents--
SELECT EmployeeID, LastName,FirstName, Title, Email
 FROM employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent"

7.--Here I found the total sales by each sales support agent and ordered them by highest to lowest. There are 3 table joins in this query--

SELECT ROUND(SUM(invoices.total)) AS "Total Sales $", employees.firstname, employees.LastName AS "Sales Agent"
FROM customers
JOIN employees
 ON employees.employeeid = customers.supportrepid
 JOIN invoices
 ON invoices.customerid = customers.CustomerId
 GROUP BY "Sales Agent"
 ORDER BY "Total Sales $" DESC
 
8. -- How many Sales in 2009?--
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceID) AS "Invoices in 2009"
FROM invoices 
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "2009%"

9.-- The 10 top customers with the highest purchase amounts--
SELECT c.CustomerId, c.FirstName, c.LastName, SUM(i.Total) AS TotalPurchaseAmount
FROM customers c
JOIN invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY c.CustomerId
ORDER BY TotalPurchaseAmount DESC
LIMIT 10;

10. -- Total number of tracks by genre --
SELECT g.Name AS Genre, COUNT(t.TrackId) AS TotalTracks
FROM genres g
JOIN tracks t ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId
GROUP BY g.Name
ORDER BY TotalTracks DESC

11. --Employees that have assisted the most customers --
SELECT e.EmployeeId, e.FirstName, e.LastName, COUNT(c.CustomerId) AS TotalCustomersAssisted
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId
ORDER BY TotalCustomersAssisted DESC
